        <h1>THE BIRD</h1>
        <p>Birds come under the class â€“ vertebrates. Birds are basically warm blooded and they lay eggs.

            Since they have a high body temperature, they utilize lots of energy and hence they needs to keep eating all the time.
            
            The bodies of birds are covered with feathers which have mainly three functions. Feathers help them in their flight, helps them to have a regulated body temperature and in some cases is also for good display. Since the bones of birds are hollow and have air sacks, they are able to fly as it makes them lighter. Wings help them in their flight.</p>
